# Blockchain-Quiz-Website

## Introduction: 
Educational technology (E-learning) allows the reduction of educational costs and the
introduction of personalized education. Online education and online testing have stated to
become widespread in the late 1980s with the expansion of internet connectivity and have
evolved from individual. Even from the first implementations of such systems, it was important to use the latest
technologies in order to offer the participants the best possible experience when browsing the
course or taking an online test. Components of an online test are the user interface, the data
storage and the business logic. Therefore, we have made a blockchain quiz system made
using solidity language and JavaScript in order to explore blockchain technologies and how
we can use it in further implementation of various other projects. 

## Techonologies Used: 
- React, nodeJs, Solidity, Truffle.
- HTML, CSS
